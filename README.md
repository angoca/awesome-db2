A curated list of awesome Db2 resources, tools and documentation to develop in that database.

Feel free to improve this list by [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

[Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Db2_(Formerly_Db2_for_LUW)) is a database server product developed by IBM. Sometimes called Db2 LUW for brevity, it is part of the [Db2 family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Db2_Family) of database products. Db2 LUW is the "Common Server" product member of the Db2 family, designed to run on most popular operating systems. By contrast, all other Db2 products are specific to a single platform.

The current Db2 product runs on multiple Linux and UNIX distributions, such as Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux, IBM AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, and most Windows systems
